# Coverage-planning-for-USV-assisted-bathymetry
This is the official end-to-end software for coverage planning for USV-assisted bathymetry survey. 


## How to start (method 1)
### Install MATLAB Runtime to run the software
The software is designed by MATLAB APP Designer, therefore the MATLAB Runtime is required to properly run the APP in a independent computer. Please download the MATLAB Runtime package at this [link](https://ssd.mathworks.cn/supportfiles/downloads/R2021a/Release/6/deployment_files/installer/complete/win64/MATLAB_Runtime_R2021a_Update_6_win64.zip). Do not download other versions since they are not compatible with the software. After downloading, please unzip the file "MATLAB_Runtime_R2021a_Update_6_win64.zip" and click setup to install the MATLAB Runtime.

### Clone this repository
Clone the code with the following command:\
`git clone https://github.com/LiangZhao13/Coverage-planning-for-USV-assisted-bathymetry.git`

### Run
Find **coverage_app.exe** and run. Click on the **Start** button, then select the "Testcase.mat" file and run. 

## How to start (method 2)
### Install MATLAB Runtime and the software together
Please download the file in this [link](https://gitlab.com/liangzhao13/coverage-planning-software.git). Run the package file "MyAppInstaller_mcr.exe" which contains proper MATLAB Runtime version and the software.

### Run 
Find **coverage_app.exe** and run. Click on the **Start** button, then select the "Testcase.mat" file and run.
