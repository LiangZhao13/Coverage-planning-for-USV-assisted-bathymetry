# Coverage-planning-for-USV-assisted-bathymetry
This is the official end-to-end software for coverage planning for USV-assisted bathymetry survey. 


## How to start
### Install MATLAB Runtime to run the software
The software is designed by MATLAB APP Designer, therefore the MATLAB Runtime is required to properly run the APP in a independent computer. Please download the MATLAB Runtime package at this [link](https://ssd.mathworks.cn/supportfiles/downloads/R2021a/Release/6/deployment_files/installer/complete/win64/MATLAB_Runtime_R2021a_Update_6_win64.zip). Do not download other versions since they are not compatible with the software. After downloading, please unzip the file "MATLAB_Runtime_R2021a_Update_6_win64.zip" and click setup to install the MATLAB Runtime.
